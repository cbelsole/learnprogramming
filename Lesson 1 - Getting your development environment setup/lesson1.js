Lesson 1: Outputting to the console.

In JS you can use the console to output information to the screen. To do this we
call console.log(). When running this code with node you should see the
information output to your terminal.

Eg. console.log("Hello World")
Hello World

For this lesson let's write a console.log() statement that says 
"Hello <your name>".

To run this code and all other code in this tutorial we'll be using node. Eg.

$ node lesson1.js
Hello Chris

A note about the terminal. There are commands that help you do things in the
terminal like list all the files (ls) and change directory (cd). If you're in
the root of your project you can find the lesson 1 folder with ls and then use
cd to go into that folder. Eg.

$ ls
'Lesson 1 - Getting your development environment setup'   README.md

$ cd Lesson\ 1\ -\ Getting\ your\ development\ environment\ setup/

$ node lesson1.js 
Hello World

To go back up a folder you use .. Eg.

$ cd ..
