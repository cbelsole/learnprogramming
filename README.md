**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT USE THIS TO LEARN PROGRAMMING UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO IT PAINFULLY SLOW**

# Learn Programming

This repo contains the basic lessons to learn programming with JavaScript (JS) because JS is immediately useful for most people since it has applications for the [web](https://reactjs.org/), [server](https://expressjs.com/), [desktop](https://www.electronjs.org/), and [mobile](https://reactnative.dev/). The aim of this tutorial is not to be a fully fleshed out resource for learning how to code. Rather, it should give you the basic high level concepts and point you towards quality resources that explain topics more in depth to help people who don't know where to start and prevent them from getting bogged down in the MOUNTAIN of tutorials out there. 

This tutorial uses three emoji for resources:

1. ðŸ“– is a resource for people who absorb information from reading.
2. ðŸŽ¥ is a resource for people who absorb information from watching a video.
3. ðŸŽ® is a resource for people who absorb information from working with concepts.

Note: This is not an exhaustive list of frameworks. If yours is not represented here it is not a slight on any particular viewpoint.

## Preface

The world of programming is large and complex. It will take time to learn the syntax and skills to be proficient. This repo does not contain nearly enough information to explain everything. What it will do is give you the tools to learn and start to solve problems. You get out what you put in. There are many different types of learners and people learn at different rates. So if you find yourself not learning at the speed you want consider trying a different form of ingesting information. Eg. Blogs, videos, exploration, official docs, 1 on 1 chats with friends, find a coding community.

The one tip I see over and over from people learning programming is to network and find a group of people who you can learn from and share with. These people will be instrumental in your success when you are trying to break into the industry. When you are lucky enough to find a mentor who you get along with to check your code and give you constructive feedback they will also be a great resource for finding positions in the industry since they have experience reading pob posts and seeing through all the jargon.

Here is where I give the shameless plug for [CodeBuddies](https://www.codebuddies.org/). They are an online community of learners for a variety of languages and frameworks who exist mostly on [Slack](https://slack.com/) to provide support for and grow with each other.

## Where to start

[Lesson 1 - Getting your development environment setup](Lesson%201%20-%20Getting%20your%20development%20environment%20setup) will help you install your code editor and write your first JS code. After that you should proceed with the lessons in order.
